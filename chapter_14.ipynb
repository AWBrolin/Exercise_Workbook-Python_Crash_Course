    "\n",
    "This notebook contains exercises from Chapter 14 of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. This chapter focuses on adding scoring systems, high scores, difficulty levels, and polished game features to create a complete, professional game experience.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives:\n",
    "- Implement comprehensive scoring systems\n",
    "- Create and manage high score functionality\n",
    "- Add difficulty levels and game progression\n",
    "- Implement play/pause/restart game states\n",
    "- Create professional UI elements and displays\n",
    "- Add visual feedback and game polish\n",
    "- Manage persistent game data\n",
