    "- Writing conditional tests using comparison operators\n",
    "- Using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)\n",
    "- Creating if, elif, and else statements\n",
    "- Testing for membership in lists (`in`, `not in`)\n",
    "- Handling different data types in conditions\n",
    "- Working with empty lists and user validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Practiced:**\n",
    "- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`\n",
    "- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "- Conditional statement structure: `if`, `elif`, `else`\n",
    "- List membership testing: `item in list`, `item not in list`\n",
    "- Case-insensitive string comparisons using `.lower()`\n",
    "- Boolean evaluation and truthiness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Review any exercises you found challenging\n",
    "- Practice writing more complex conditional logic\n",
    "- Combine conditionals with loops for powerful programs\n",
    "- Move on to Chapter 6: Dictionaries\n",
