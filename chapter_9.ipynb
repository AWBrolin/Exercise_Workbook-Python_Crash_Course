    "Congratulations! You've completed all the exercises for Chapter 9 on Classes. You should now be comfortable with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating classes with the `class` keyword\n",
    "- Defining `__init__()` methods to initialize instances\n",
    "- Creating instance attributes and methods\n",
    "- Using inheritance to create specialized classes\n",
    "- Overriding methods in child classes\n",
    "- Creating instances as attributes of other classes\n",
    "- Importing classes from modules\n",
    "- Working with the Python standard library\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Practiced:**\n",
    "- Class definition syntax: `class ClassName:`\n",
    "- Instance creation and attribute access\n",
    "- Method definition and calling\n",
    "- Inheritance syntax: `class ChildClass(ParentClass):`\n",
    "- The `super()` function for accessing parent methods\n",
    "- Composition: using instances as attributes\n",
    "- Module organization and imports\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Principles:**\n",
    "- Classes model real-world objects and concepts\n",
    "- Use descriptive class and method names\n",
    "- Keep classes focused on a single responsibility\n",
    "- Use inheritance to model \"is-a\" relationships\n",
    "- Use composition to model \"has-a\" relationships\n",
    "- Organize related classes into modules\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Review any exercises you found challenging\n",
    "- Practice modeling real-world objects as classes\n",
    "- Experiment with more complex inheritance hierarchies\n",
    "- Move on to Chapter 10: Files and Exceptions\n",
